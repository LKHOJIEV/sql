What is DQL?
Data Query Language (DQL) is used to fetch the data from the database. It uses only one command:

SELECT
This command helps you to select the attribute based on the condition described by the WHERE clause.

Syntax:

SELECT expressions    
FROM TABLES    
WHERE conditions;  
For example:

SELECT FirstName  
FROM Student  
WHERE RollNo > 15;
